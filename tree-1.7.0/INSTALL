Installation instructions:

Important: Note for MINGW user

When opening a MINGW terminal you run the C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat batch file.
When opening a MSYS terminal you run the
 C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\msys.bat MSYS 
batch file. Note the option MSYS after the command.

It is not possible to compile with the MINGW gcc toolchain.
You must use the MSYS gcc toolchain (MSYS is a CYGWIN derived system).
See the following url to have a MSYS system: 
http://www.mingw.org/wiki/HOWTO_Create_an_MSYS_Build_Environment
After compilation and installation, you can use the tree command
in MINGW.

End MINGW

  I cannot test on non-Linux machines, so please feel free to contribute
porting information, bug reports, compile options, patches, etc for porting to
other OS's to ice@mama.indstate.edu.

  I would also welcome any localization efforts, particularly translating the
man page to other languages.  And of course feel free to suggest options and
improvements you would like to see in tree.
